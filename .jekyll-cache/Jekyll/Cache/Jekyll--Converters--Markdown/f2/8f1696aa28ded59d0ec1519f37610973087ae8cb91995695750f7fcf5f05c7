<p>I bet youâ€™ve try to developed (V)ersion (C)ontrol (S)ystem prototype by yourself before. ie. you a product manager, you write a requirement document named v1.0, 
the document need be reviewed by your boss, your client and your teammates. Then you collect all suggestions and modify the document, naming it 
version v1.1. This operation makes everyone understand that the document is been upgraded when you send it to them, also lets you easily start revising from
any version.</p>
