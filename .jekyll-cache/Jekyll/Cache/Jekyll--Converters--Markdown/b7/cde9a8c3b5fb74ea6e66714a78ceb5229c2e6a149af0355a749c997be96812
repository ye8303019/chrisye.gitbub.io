<p>As the development of the life-science industry around China and global, more and more requirements from drug manufacturers, bio-techs, they really need a platform which could speedup their decision-making process. For some historical reason, until now, most of the platforms in the world are under the TOB model. Customers don’t even know what the platform looks like before they decide to book a demo from sales rep. Under this situation, PLG should be a great way for decision makers in the life-science industry. By mentioning PLG, then you can’t ignore a person, Wes Bush, the founder of PLG institute, and his book <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PRODUCT - LED GROWTH</code> which was published in 2019, and here are some key takeaways from this book. <br />

<h2 id="why-plg">Why PLG</h2>
<p>Before we get into PLG, first, let’s take a look into OpenView who coined PLG.
<a href="https://discovery.patsnap.com/company-profile/3f42425756771203cd954c2386d8efdc/snapshot"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PLG/openview.png" alt="openview" /></a></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>“OpenView is the leading VC investing in product-led growth. They bring a unique 
perspective to their work with Calendly.  Their network has also been impactful 
to our success. Many of  OpenView’s introductions have turned into advisors or 
employees at Calendly.”				
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And from their investment industry distribution, it’s not a surprise to get that PLG is almost suitable for any digital market area, especially for <font color="green"><b> SaaS tools </b></font>.
<a href="https://discovery.patsnap.com/company-profile/3f42425756771203cd954c2386d8efdc/investment"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PLG/openview_investment.png" alt="openview_investment.png" /></a></p>

<p>Here is an list from OpenView website, it reveal the top companies who are using PLG to boost their business.
<a href="https://openviewpartners.com/product-led-growth-index/"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PLG/openview_plg_list.png" alt="openview.plg_list" /></a></p>

<p>From the book, Wes said <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Product-Led Growth is a go-to-market strategy tha relies on using your product as the main vehicle to acquire, activate and retain customers.</code> <br />
As the SaaS industry evolves, there will be two types of companies,</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sales-led companies represent the old way. It’s complex, unnecessary, expensive, and all about telling cinsumers how the product will benefit them. These companies want to take you from Point A to Point B in their sales cycle.</li>
  <li>Product-led companies flip the traditional sales model on its head. Instead of helping buyers go through a long, drawn-out sales cycle, they give the buyer the “keys” to their product. The company, in turn, focuses on helping the buyer improve their lif. Upgradeing to a paid plan becomes a no-brainer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then we come to an important part which is there are three <font color="red"><b>  Tidal Waves </b></font> coming for subscription business.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Startups are more expensive to grow</li>
  <li>Buyer now are prefer to self-education</li>
  <li>Product experiences have become an essential part of the buying process</li>
</ul>

<p>Won’t say Sales-led GTM strategy is totally useless, but somehow, under these situations, purely Sales-Led GTM strategy is at risk for SaaS business. Let’s check the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Pros &amp; Cons</code> for Sales-Led.</p>

<font color="green"><b> Pros:  </b></font>

<ul>
  <li>Ability to close high Lifetime Value(LTV) customers</li>
  <li>Perfect for hyper-niche solutions (In contrast, the Product-Led model is build for a large Total Addressable Market [TAM] where you can scale rapidly)</li>
  <li>Perfect for new categories
    <ul>
      <li>If you jump too quickly to a product-led model with a new category, you risk a high churn rate because you simply don’t understand what it takes for customers to succeed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<font color="red"><b> Cons:  </b></font>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>High customer acquisition costs(CAC)</p>
  </li>
  <li>The customer acquisition model is leaky
    <ul>
      <li>It encourages marketers to gate content to hit their MQL goals</li>
      <li>It focuses on content consumption as a leading indicator of intent</li>
      <li>The entire process rewards creating friction in the buying process</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The organizational structure hinders great product development
    <ul>
      <li>The problem with this organizational structure is that the product is often an afterthought.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>PLG is not an easy-implementation strategy for GTM, <strong><em>you need to make sure that every team has a hand in helping each user become successful</em></strong>.</p>

<font color="green"><b> Pros:  </b></font>

<ul>
  <li>Dominant growth engine
    <ul>
      <li>Wider top-of-funnel</li>
      <li>Rapid global scale</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A significantly lower CAC
    <ul>
      <li>Faster sales cycles</li>
      <li>High revenue-per-employee(RPE)
        <ul>
          <li>If you try to double-size your revenue, more sales reps? Yes but no, SLG always has an limitation on RPE, can’t always rely on it.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Better user experience
        <ul>
          <li>At least, customers could <strong><em>Try Before They Buy</em></strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="free-trial-freemium-or-demo">Free Trial, Freemium, or Demo</h2>
<p>What works for those successful companies may be won’t necessarily work for you. At this point you need a decision framework to compare the free-trial, freemium, and demo trials. In the book, author introduce the <strong><em>MOAT</em></strong> framework which could help to pick the right GTM strategy.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>M</strong>arket Strategy: Is your GTM strategy dominant, disruptive, or differentiated?</li>
  <li><strong>O</strong>cean Condition: Are you in a red -or blue-ocean business?</li>
  <li><strong>A</strong>udience: Do you have a top-down or bottom-up marketing strategy?</li>
  <li><strong>T</strong>ime-to-value: How fast can you showcase value?</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember this framework, it will be mentioned or explained for several times in the following chapters.  Then back to the market strategy, free-trial, freemium and demo trial, now it might seem like freemium is just an indefinite free trial, but the GTM strategies could not be more different. Let’s put these three into a matrix which <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Charge Status</code> in X axis, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gets Job Done</code> for Y axis at same time, then see what kind of strategies that the book tell us and what’s the differences.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PLG/PLG_Different_Strategies.png" alt="PLG_Different_Strategies" /></p>

<p>There are unique advantage for these 3 strategies, author structure them one by one as followed:</p>

<p><strong><em>Dominant SaaS Growth Strategy</em></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Works great if you can <strong><em>do something much better</em></strong> than your market and can <strong><em>charge significantly less</em></strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>The book tell us <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Netflix</code> is the one who take the dominant SaaS strategy, yes, it’s totally right before 2019, the lowest price around <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$9.99/month</code> for basic plan, and nearly 4,000 films and 1,500 shows, no fierce opponents. As the development of the competitor such Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime, Netflix is about to remove free trial in UK and raise the price to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$12.98/month</code>. Now it’s market strategy more like a hybrid model which more nearby differential strategy.<br />
<img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PLG/Netflix.png" alt="Netflix" />
        <ul>
          <li><strong><em>Both freemium and free-trial models</em></strong> works much better than the traditional sales model in the dominant growth strategy because you keep costs low and prevent competitors from stealing your market share. <strong><em>Freemium</em></strong> is vital in a dominant growth strategy and can help you take a sizeable chunk out of a market.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ElasticSearch</code> is a good case for dominant strategy. Totally free for personal use or for light use for enterprise, great ecosystem, user-friendly, high performance etc. etc. etc. Now the market capitalization for ElasticSearch is around 8B and with a peak for 14B.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, the question before you take the actions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is your TAM big enough to support a freemium model?
    <ul>
      <li>If you are in a niche market, for example, only 50 stable customers as TAM, then forget about PLG.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Does your product solve a specific job significantly better and at a lower cost than anyone else in the market?</li>
  <li>Can your user realize significant ongoing value quickly with <strong><em>little-to-no help</em></strong> from company personnel?</li>
  <li>Do you want to be the undisputed market leader in your category?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Differentiated SaaS Growth Strategy</em></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Try this strategy if you pick your <strong><em>fight with the industry goliath</em></strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>For instance, a data search engine startup trying to survive the competition with a public company, then the startup should considerate the differentiated strategy. Focus on a market that the competitor not that urgent to touch and also doing better than the public company just in resolving customer’s problem who is in this niche market.</li>
      <li>This strategy requires you to do <strong><em>a specific job better than the competition</em></strong> and <strong><em>charge significantly more</em></strong>.</li>
      <li><strong><em>Both free-trial and demos</em></strong> works great with a differentiated approach, but due to the TAM, a freemium model often will not work well in this environment.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, the question before you take the actions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is your market comprised of underserved customers?</li>
  <li>What is your TAM?</li>
  <li>Is your Annual Contract Value (ACV) high enough to support a low- or high-touch sales team?</li>
  <li>Could your prospects experience an “Aha!” moment during a free trial.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Disruptive SaaS Growth Strategy</em></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Require <strong><em>charge less</em></strong> for what many might consider an <strong><em>“inferior product”</em></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Compare to Adobe Photoshop, Canva, a online design tool which much easier to use, and really fit for those over-served customers who just want to create a social media graphics in seconds.
  <a href="https://www.canva.com/"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PLG/canva_homepage.png" alt="canva_homepage" /></a></li>
      <li>The products which take disruptive SaaS growth strategy:
        <ul>
          <li>Google Docs (Relative to Microsoft Word);</li>
          <li>Udacity (Relative to traditional universities);</li>
          <li>Wave (Relative to traditional accounting software);</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Since the product is a scaled-down version of an existing solution, it must be <font color="green"><b>easy to use</b></font>.</li>
      <li><strong><em>Freemium model</em></strong> thrives in the disruptive environment. It keeps costs low for drawing in prospects by using existing solutions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, the question before you take the actions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is your market full of over-served customers?</li>
  <li>Are you competing in a hyper-competitive market?</li>
  <li>Is your market large enough to support a freemium model? (Hint: Look to your competitors to gauge the market size)</li>
  <li>Do you have the resources to support a freemium model?</li>
  <li>Can your onboarding be completely self-services?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Make The Decision</em></strong> <br />
Now need you to make the decision on your growth strategy, questions to ask yourself when deciding on your market strategy:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do you want to offer the best solution for the lowest price? (Dominant strategy)</li>
  <li>Do you want to offer the best-customized solution for the highest price to underserved customers? (Differentiated strategy)</li>
  <li>Do you want to offer the simplest product for the lowest price to our-served customers? (Disruptive strategy)</li>
  <li>Or are you planning on using a hybrid strategy?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="red-or-blue-ocean">Red or Blue Ocean</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.launch-marketing.com/red-vs-blue-ocean-strategies/"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PLG/blue-read-ocean.jpg" alt="blue-read-ocean" /></a>
Before we dive into how your ocean strategy will affect your PLG model, let’s check the differences between <font color="red"><b>Red-ocean</b></font> and <font color="blue"><b>Blue-ocean</b></font>.</p>
<font color="red"><b>Red-Ocean:</b></font>
<p>Red-ocean companies try to outperform their rivals to grab a greater share of existing demand. (Harvest Demand)</p>

<font color="blue"><b>Blue-Ocean:</b></font>
<p>Blue-ocean companies access untapped market space and create demand. (Create Demand)</p>

<p><strong>PS</strong>: One thing should be noted that even in the same market, depends on what market segment you are focus on, the strategy for red-ocean or blue-ocean could be different. For instance which the book tells us that, BI is a bloody red-ocean, but you could just focus on SMB which is a blue-ocean in 2019.</p>

<p><strong>Why dose this matter to PLG?</strong>  <br />
Depends on what kind of business you are doing, the strategy for blue-ocean could be different. For most of the time, leverage SLG is a good choice for blue-ocean, because blue-ocean mean your idea or concept is quite new to the end-users, the market is not that mature. You need to educate user and deliver your value to specific customer at first. Like sales-force at very beginning. However, we can’t deny, if your business is quick time-to-value, use PLG is also a great idea. For example your product is as simple as Spotify, everybody need it every day etc. SLG is the beginning but not the end, you need to ask “when” not “if” you’re going to launch a PLG arm of business.  <br />
In a red-ocean, market share, CAC is everything. You need to grow as fast and profitably as possible. PLG help you widen your funnel,  decrease your CAC and help you expand globally in a fraction of time, also could convert “non-customers” - people who typically won’t reach out to request pricing or sign up for a demo request. However, these non-customers are willing to try your product if it’s in PLG model.</p>

<p><strong>Questions to ask yourself when deciding between a blue or red ocean?</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Am I creating or capturing existing demand?</li>
  <li>Does the product have a quick time-to-value?</li>
  <li>Will a marketing, sales, or product-led GTM suit my business the best?</li>
</ol>

<p>No matter which you select, there are a few things to keep in mind. First of all, it is important to remember that value creation and innovation are critical success factors. Also, remain aware of the industry that you are competing against as well as new introductions to the market that may disrupt any market share that you have attained</p>

<h2 id="top-down-or-button-up">Top Down or Button Up</h2>
<p>From audience prospective, to-down or button-up strategy are always be needed.
<a href="https://www.cleverism.com/top-vs-bottom-selling-strategies-best-business"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PLG/buttonup-topdown.png" alt="button-up-top-down" /></a>  <br />
© Shutterstock.com | Micolas  <br />
When using a top-down selling strategy, your sales team targets key decision-markers and executives, and one reason the top-down sales strategy exists is that business want uniformity. Decision makers like to keep their business organized and allocate resources efficiently. For instance, SAP, Oracle, IBM, the business they are making need them to reach out the key decision makers at very beginning, then convince internal teams to use for software is step 2.
Unlike the top-down selling strategy, where it may take months or years to close a sale, bottom-up selling strategies demand quick adoption and simplicity. A big reason to choose a PLG in bottom-up strategy is that if people can’t see the value in using your product quickly, fiw will upgrade.</p>

<p>Pros and Cons of top-down and bottom-up selling strategies.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A top-down selling strategy pairs well with a sales-led go-to-market strategy</li>
  <li>A bottom-up selling strategy works almost exclusively with a product-led go-to-market strategy</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Top-Down Selling Strategy</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Poor revenue distribution</li>

  <li>Wider top-of-funnel</li>
  <li>Lower CAC</li>
  <li>Predictable sales figures</li>
  <li>Revenue Diversity</li>

<p><strong>What selling strategy is right for you?</strong>
If your product has a freemium model and a top-down selling strategy, the two approaches will repel each other.
<strong>Freemium and top-down selling</strong></p>

<p><strong>Freemium or free trial and bottom-up selling</strong></p>

<p><strong>Free trial and top-down selling</strong></p>

<p><strong>Questions to ask yourself when deciding between a top-down or bottom-up selling strategy</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Are you currently targeting people who can easily use your product and experience its value?</li>
  <li>What is your ACV for each customer? Is it high engough to justify a low- or high-touch sales model?</li>
</ul>
