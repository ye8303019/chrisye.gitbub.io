<p>As the development of the life-science industry around China and global, more and more requirements from drug manufacturers, bio-techs, they really need a platform¬†which¬†could speedup their decision-making¬†process. For some historical reason, until now, most of the platforms in the world are under the TOB model. Customers don‚Äôt even know what the platform looks like before they decide to book a demo from sales rep. Under this situation, PLG should be a great way for decision makers in the life-science industry. By mentioning PLG, then you can‚Äôt ignore a person, Wes Bush, the founder of PLG institute, and his book <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PRODUCT - LED GROWTH</code> which was published in 2019, and here are some key takeaways from this book. <br />

<h2 id="why-plg">Why PLG</h2>
<p>Before we get into PLG, first, let‚Äôs take a look into OpenView who coined PLG.
<a href="https://discovery.patsnap.com/company-profile/3f42425756771203cd954c2386d8efdc/snapshot"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PLG/openview.png" alt="openview" /></a></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>‚ÄúOpenView is the leading VC investing in product-led growth. They bring a unique 
perspective to their work with Calendly.  Their network has also been impactful 
to our success. Many of  OpenView‚Äôs introductions have turned into advisors or 
employees at Calendly.‚Äù				
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And from their investment industry distribution, it‚Äôs not a surprise to get that PLG is almost suitable for any digital market area, especially for &lt;font color=‚Äùgreen‚Äù font-weight:‚Äù‚Äù&gt; SaaS tools &lt;/font&gt;.
<a href="https://discovery.patsnap.com/company-profile/3f42425756771203cd954c2386d8efdc/investment"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PLG/openview_investment.png" alt="openview_investment.png" /></a></p>

<p>Here is an list from OpenView website, it reveal the top companies who are using PLG to boost their business.
<a href="https://openviewpartners.com/product-led-growth-index/"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PLG/openview_plg_list.png" alt="openview.plg_list" /></a></p>

<p>From the book, Wes said <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Product-Led Growth is a go-to-market strategy tha relies on using your product as the main vehicle to acquire, activate and retain customers.</code> <br />
As the SaaS industry evolves, there will be two types of companies,</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sales-led companies represent the old way. It‚Äôs complex, unnecessary, expensive, and all about telling cinsumers how the product will benefit them. These companies want to take you from Point A to Point B in their sales cycle.</li>
  <li>Product-led companies flip the traditional sales model on its head. Instead of helping buyers go through a long, drawn-out sales cycle, they give the buyer the ‚Äúkeys‚Äù to their product. The company, in turn, focuses on helping the buyer improve their lif. Upgradeing to a paid plan becomes a no-brainer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then we come to an important part which is there are three <font color="red">  Tidal Waves </font> coming for subscription business.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Startups are more expensive to grow</li>
  <li>Buyer now are prefer to self-education</li>
  <li>Product experiences have become an essential part of the buying process</li>
</ul>

<p>Won‚Äôt say Sales-led GTM strategy is totally useless, but somehow, under these situations, purely Sales-Led GTM strategy is at risk for SaaS business. Let‚Äôs check the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Pros &amp; Cons</code> for Sales-Led.</p>

<font color="green"> Pros:  </font>

<ul>
  <li>Ability to close high Lifetime Value(LTV) customers</li>
  <li>Perfect for hyper-niche solutions (In contrast, the Product-Led model is build for a large Total Addressable Market [TAM] where you can scale rapidly)</li>
  <li>Perfect for new categories
    <ul>
      <li>If you jump too quickly to a product-led model with a new category, you risk a high churn rate because you simply don‚Äôt understand what it takes for customers to succeed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<font color="red"> Cons:  </font>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>High customer acquisition costs(CAC)</p>
  </li>
  <li>The customer acquisition model is leaky
    <ul>
      <li>It encourages marketers to gate content to hit their MQL goals</li>
      <li>It focuses on content consumption as a leading indicator of intent</li>
      <li>The entire process rewards creating friction in the buying process</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The organizational structure hinders great product development
    <ul>
      <li>The problem with this organizational structure is that the product is often an afterthought.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>PLG is not an easy-implementation strategy for GTM, <strong><em>you need to make sure that every team has a hand in helping each user become successful</em></strong>.</p>

<font color="green"> Pros:  </font>

<ul>
  <li>Dominant growth engine
    <ul>
      <li>Wider top-of-funnel</li>
      <li>Rapid global scale</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A significantly lower CAC
    <ul>
      <li>Faster sales cycles</li>
      <li>High revenue-per-employee(RPE)
        <ul>
          <li>If you try to double-size your revenue, more sales reps? Yes but no, SLG always has an limitation on RPE, can‚Äôt always rely on it.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Better user experience
        <ul>
          <li>At least, customers could <strong><em>Try Before They Buy</em></strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="free-trial-freemium-or-demo">Free Trial, Freemium, or Demo</h2>
<p>What works for those successful companies may be won‚Äôt necessarily work for you. At this point you need a decision framework to compare the free-trial, freemium, and demo trials. In the book, author introduce the <strong><em>MOAT</em></strong> framework which could help to pick the right GTM strategy.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>M</strong>arket Strategy: Is your GTM strategy dominant, disruptive, or differentiated?</li>
  <li><strong>O</strong>cean Condition: Are you in a red -or blue-ocean business?</li>
  <li><strong>A</strong>udience: Do you have a top-down or bottom-up marketing strategy?</li>
  <li><strong>T</strong>ime-to-value: How fast can you showcase value?</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember this framework, it will be mentioned or explained for several times in the following chapters.  Then back to the market strategy, free-trial, freemium and demo trial, now it might seem like freemium is just an indefinite free trial, but the GTM strategies could not be more different. Let‚Äôs put these three into a matrix which <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Charge Status</code> in X axis, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gets Job Done</code> for Y axis at same time, then see what kind of strategies that the book tell us and what‚Äôs the differences.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PLG/PLG_Different Strategies.png" alt="PLG_Different Strategies" /></p>

<p>There are unique advantage for these 3 strategies, author structure them one by one as followed:</p>

<p><strong><em>Dominant SaaS Growth Strategy</em></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Works great if you can <strong><em>do something much better</em></strong> than your market and can <strong><em>charge significantly less</em></strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>The companies which take dominant SaaS growth strategy: Netflix; Uber; Shopify;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Before you take the actions, let‚Äôs ask some questions to yourselves:</li>
  <li>Is your TAM big enough to support a freemium model?
    <ul>
      <li>If you are in a niche market, for example, only 50 stable customers as TAM, then forget about PLG.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Does your product solve a specific job significantly better and at a lower cost than anyone else in the market.</li>
  <li>Can your user realize significant ongoing value quickly with <strong><em>little-to-no help</em></strong> from company personnel?</li>
  <li>
    <p>Do you want to be the undisputed market leader in your category?</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong><em>Both freemium and free-trial models</em></strong> works much better than the traditional sales model in the dominant growth strategy because you keep costs low and prevent competitors from stealing your market share.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Differentiated SaaS Growth Strategy</em></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Try this strategy if you pick your fight with the industry goliath.</li>
  <li>This strategy requires you to do a specific job better than the competition and charge significantly more.</li>
  <li>Before you take the actions, let‚Äôs ask some questions to ourselves:
    <ul>
      <li>Is your market comprised of underserved customers?</li>
      <li>What is your TAM?</li>
      <li>Is your Annual Contract Value (ACV) high enough to support a low- or high-touch sales team?</li>
      <li>Could your prospects experience an ‚ÄúAha!‚Äù moment during a free trial.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong><em>Both free-trial and demos</em></strong> works great with a differentiated approach, but due to the TAM, a freenium model often will not work well in this environment</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Disruptive SaaS Growth Strategy</em></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Require charge less for what many might consider an ‚Äúinferior product‚Äù
    <ul>
      <li>Compare to Adobe Photoshop, Canva, a online design tool which much easier to use, and really fit for those over-served customers who just want to create a social media graphics in seconds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The products which take disruptive SaaS growth strategy: Google Docs (Relative to Microsoft Word); Udacity (Relative to traditional universities); Wave (Relative to traditional accounting software);</li>
  <li>Since the product is a scaled-down version of an existing solution, it must be easy to use.</li>
  <li>Before we take the actions, let‚Äôs ask some questions to ourselves:
    <ul>
      <li>Is your market full of over-served customers?</li>
      <li>Are you competing in a hyper-competitive market?</li>
      <li>Is your market large enough to support a freemium model? (Hint: Look to your competitors to gauge the market size)</li>
      <li>Do you have the resources to support a freemium model?</li>
      <li>Can your onboarding be completely self-services?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong><em>Freemium model</em></strong> thrives in the disruptive environment. It keeps costs low for drawing in prospects by using existing solutions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Takeways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do you want to offer the best solution for the lowest price? (Dominant strategy)</li>
  <li>Do you want to offer the best-customized solution for the highest price to underserved customers? (Differentiated strategy)</li>
  <li>Do you want to offer the simplest product for the lowest price to our-served customers? (Disruptive strategy)</li>
  <li>Or are you planning on using a hybrid strategy?</li>
</ul>
