<p>As the development of the life-science industry around China and global, more and more requirements from drug manufacturers, bio-techs, they really need a platform¬†which¬†could speedup their decision-making¬†process. For some historical reason, until now, most of the platforms in the world are under the TOB model. Customers don‚Äôt even know what the platform looks like before they decide to book a demo from sales rep. Under this situation, PLG should be a great way for decision makers in the life-science industry. By mentioning PLG, then you can‚Äôt ignore a person, Wes Bush, the founder of PLG institute, and his book <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PRODUCT - LED GROWTH</code> which was published in 2019, and here are some key takeaways from this book. <br />

<h2 id="why-plg">Why PLG</h2>
<p>Before we get into PLG, first, let‚Äôs take a look into OpenView who coined PLG.
<a href="https://discovery.patsnap.com/company-profile/3f42425756771203cd954c2386d8efdc/snapshot"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PLG/openview.png" alt="openview" /></a></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>‚ÄúOpenView is the leading VC investing in product-led growth. They bring a unique 
perspective to their work with Calendly.  Their network has also been impactful 
to our success. Many of  OpenView‚Äôs introductions have turned into advisors or 
employees at Calendly.‚Äù				
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And from their investment industry distribution, it‚Äôs not a surprise to get that PLG is almost suitable for any digital market area, especially for <font color="green"><b> SaaS tools </b></font>.
<a href="https://discovery.patsnap.com/company-profile/3f42425756771203cd954c2386d8efdc/investment"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PLG/openview_investment.png" alt="openview_investment.png" /></a></p>

<p>Here is an list from OpenView website, it reveal the top companies who are using PLG to boost their business.
<a href="https://openviewpartners.com/product-led-growth-index/"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PLG/openview_plg_list.png" alt="openview.plg_list" /></a></p>

<p>From the book, Wes said <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Product-Led Growth is a go-to-market strategy tha relies on using your product as the main vehicle to acquire, activate and retain customers.</code> <br />
As the SaaS industry evolves, there will be two types of companies,</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sales-led companies represent the old way. It‚Äôs complex, unnecessary, expensive, and all about telling cinsumers how the product will benefit them. These companies want to take you from Point A to Point B in their sales cycle.</li>
  <li>Product-led companies flip the traditional sales model on its head. Instead of helping buyers go through a long, drawn-out sales cycle, they give the buyer the ‚Äúkeys‚Äù to their product. The company, in turn, focuses on helping the buyer improve their lif. Upgradeing to a paid plan becomes a no-brainer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then we come to an important part which is there are three <font color="red"><b>  Tidal Waves </b></font> coming for subscription business.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Startups are more expensive to grow</li>
  <li>Buyer now are prefer to self-education</li>
  <li>Product experiences have become an essential part of the buying process</li>
</ul>

<p>Won‚Äôt say Sales-led GTM strategy is totally useless, but somehow, under these situations, purely Sales-Led GTM strategy is at risk for SaaS business. Let‚Äôs check the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Pros &amp; Cons</code> for Sales-Led.</p>

<font color="green"><b> Pros:  </b></font>

<ul>
  <li>Ability to close high Lifetime Value(LTV) customers</li>
  <li>Perfect for hyper-niche solutions (In contrast, the Product-Led model is build for a large Total Addressable Market [TAM] where you can scale rapidly)</li>
  <li>Perfect for new categories
    <ul>
      <li>If you jump too quickly to a product-led model with a new category, you risk a high churn rate because you simply don‚Äôt understand what it takes for customers to succeed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<font color="red"><b> Cons:  </b></font>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>High customer acquisition costs(CAC)</p>
  </li>
  <li>The customer acquisition model is leaky
    <ul>
      <li>It encourages marketers to gate content to hit their MQL goals</li>
      <li>It focuses on content consumption as a leading indicator of intent</li>
      <li>The entire process rewards creating friction in the buying process</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The organizational structure hinders great product development
    <ul>
      <li>The problem with this organizational structure is that the product is often an afterthought.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>PLG is not an easy-implementation strategy for GTM, <strong><em>you need to make sure that every team has a hand in helping each user become successful</em></strong>.</p>

<font color="green"><b> Pros:  </b></font>

<ul>
  <li>Dominant growth engine
    <ul>
      <li>Wider top-of-funnel</li>
      <li>Rapid global scale</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A significantly lower CAC
    <ul>
      <li>Faster sales cycles</li>
      <li>High revenue-per-employee(RPE)
        <ul>
          <li>If you try to double-size your revenue, more sales reps? Yes but no, SLG always has an limitation on RPE, can‚Äôt always rely on it.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Better user experience
        <ul>
          <li>At least, customers could <strong><em>Try Before They Buy</em></strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="free-trial-freemium-or-demo">Free Trial, Freemium, or Demo</h2>
<p>What works for those successful companies may be won‚Äôt necessarily work for you. At this point you need a decision framework to compare the free-trial, freemium, and demo trials. In the book, author introduce the <strong><em>MOAT</em></strong> framework which could help to pick the right GTM strategy.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>M</strong>arket Strategy: Is your GTM strategy dominant, disruptive, or differentiated?</li>
  <li><strong>O</strong>cean Condition: Are you in a red -or blue-ocean business?</li>
  <li><strong>A</strong>udience: Do you have a top-down or bottom-up marketing strategy?</li>
  <li><strong>T</strong>ime-to-value: How fast can you showcase value?</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember this framework, it will be mentioned or explained for several times in the following chapters.  Then back to the market strategy, free-trial, freemium and demo trial, now it might seem like freemium is just an indefinite free trial, but the GTM strategies could not be more different. Let‚Äôs put these three into a matrix which <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Charge Status</code> in X axis, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gets Job Done</code> for Y axis at same time, then see what kind of strategies that the book tell us and what‚Äôs the differences.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PLG/PLG_Different_Strategies.png" alt="PLG_Different_Strategies" /></p>

<p>There are unique advantage for these 3 strategies, author structure them one by one as followed:</p>

<p><strong><em>Dominant SaaS Growth Strategy</em></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Works great if you can <strong><em>do something much better</em></strong> than your market and can <strong><em>charge significantly less</em></strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>The book tell us <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Netflix</code> is the one who take the dominant SaaS strategy, yes, it‚Äôs totally right before 2019, the lowest price around <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$9.99/month</code> for basic plan, and nearly 4,000 films and 1,500 shows, no fierce opponents. As the development of the competitor such Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime, Netflix is about to remove free trial in UK and raise the price to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$12.98/month</code>. Now it‚Äôs market strategy more like a hybrid model which more nearby differential strategy.<br />
<img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PLG/Netflix.png" alt="Netflix" />
        <ul>
          <li><strong><em>Both freemium and free-trial models</em></strong> works much better than the traditional sales model in the dominant growth strategy because you keep costs low and prevent competitors from stealing your market share. <strong><em>Freemium</em></strong> is vital in a dominant growth strategy and can help you take a sizeable chunk out of a market.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ElasticSearch</code> is a good case for dominant strategy. Totally free for personal use or for light use for enterprise, great ecosystem, user-friendly, high performance etc. etc. etc. Now the market capitalization for ElasticSearch is around 8B and with a peak for 14B.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, the question before you take the actions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is your TAM big enough to support a freemium model?
    <ul>
      <li>If you are in a niche market, for example, only 50 stable customers as TAM, then forget about PLG.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Does your product solve a specific job significantly better and at a lower cost than anyone else in the market?</li>
  <li>Can your user realize significant ongoing value quickly with <strong><em>little-to-no help</em></strong> from company personnel?</li>
  <li>Do you want to be the undisputed market leader in your category?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Differentiated SaaS Growth Strategy</em></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Try this strategy if you pick your <strong><em>fight with the industry goliath</em></strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>For instance, a data search engine startup trying to survive the competition with a public company, then the startup should considerate the differentiated strategy. Focus on a market that the competitor not that urgent to touch and also doing better than the public company just in resolving customer‚Äôs problem who is in this niche market.</li>
      <li>This strategy requires you to do <strong><em>a specific job better than the competition</em></strong> and <strong><em>charge significantly more</em></strong>.</li>
      <li><strong><em>Both free-trial and demos</em></strong> works great with a differentiated approach, but due to the TAM, a freemium model often will not work well in this environment.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, the question before you take the actions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is your market comprised of underserved customers?</li>
  <li>What is your TAM?</li>
  <li>Is your Annual Contract Value (ACV) high enough to support a low- or high-touch sales team?</li>
  <li>Could your prospects experience an ‚ÄúAha!‚Äù moment during a free trial.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Disruptive SaaS Growth Strategy</em></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Require <strong><em>charge less</em></strong> for what many might consider an <strong><em>‚Äúinferior product‚Äù</em></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Compare to Adobe Photoshop, Canva, a online design tool which much easier to use, and really fit for those over-served customers who just want to create a social media graphics in seconds.
  <a href="https://www.canva.com/"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PLG/canva_homepage.png" alt="canva_homepage" /></a></li>
      <li>The products which take disruptive SaaS growth strategy:
        <ul>
          <li>Google Docs (Relative to Microsoft Word);</li>
          <li>Udacity (Relative to traditional universities);</li>
          <li>Wave (Relative to traditional accounting software);</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Since the product is a scaled-down version of an existing solution, it must be <font color="green"><b>easy to use</b></font>.</li>
      <li><strong><em>Freemium model</em></strong> thrives in the disruptive environment. It keeps costs low for drawing in prospects by using existing solutions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, the question before you take the actions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is your market full of over-served customers?</li>
  <li>Are you competing in a hyper-competitive market?</li>
  <li>Is your market large enough to support a freemium model? (Hint: Look to your competitors to gauge the market size)</li>
  <li>Do you have the resources to support a freemium model?</li>
  <li>Can your onboarding be completely self-services?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Make The Decision</em></strong> <br />
Now need you to make the decision on your growth strategy, questions to ask yourself when deciding on your market strategy:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do you want to offer the best solution for the lowest price? (Dominant strategy)</li>
  <li>Do you want to offer the best-customized solution for the highest price to underserved customers? (Differentiated strategy)</li>
  <li>Do you want to offer the simplest product for the lowest price to our-served customers? (Disruptive strategy)</li>
  <li>Or are you planning on using a hybrid strategy?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you still hard to make your decision, here is an entrance for <a href="https://productled.com/quiz/">Testing Which Growth Model You Should Choose</a>, you can answer same question at different stage, then the result may different. Also, beside free-trial and freemium, consider whether a hybrid model might work too.  <br />
<strong>Hybrid Model 1: Launch a new product</strong>
Launch a new product could let you experiment with PLG, build in-house expertise and vet if the model will work, but also, the most important thing is you could de-risk your business.</p>

<p><strong>Hybrid Model 2: Go freemium, with a trial</strong>
If you have a product with lots of features, this strategy can work well. Like HubSpot, you get immediate value from the product, but as you get more value from the free product, they tempt you with free-trial landing pages for blocked features. This allows the user to experience the new feature for a limited amount of time before upgrading.</p>

<p><strong>Hybrid Model 3: Go free trial, follow with freemium</strong>
If user can‚Äôt convert until 7 days or 30 days free-trial passed, this may due to several reasons, like user do not have enough budget this year, or they are waiting until your product became more completely. Then you could prompt them using your freemium version at least, and keep your solution at the top their mind.
<a href="https://discovery.zhihuiya.com/company-profile/2ad6ca0d05d8f6752450b2085b36a0c5/snapshot"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PLG/nudgeai.png" alt="nudgeai" /></a></p>

<h2 id="red-or-blue-ocean">Red or Blue Ocean</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.launch-marketing.com/red-vs-blue-ocean-strategies/"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PLG/blue-read-ocean.jpg" alt="blue-read-ocean" /></a>
Before we dive into how your ocean strategy will affect your PLG model, let‚Äôs check the differences between <font color="red"><b>Red-ocean</b></font> and <font color="blue"><b>Blue-ocean</b></font>.</p>
<font color="red"><b>Red-Ocean:</b></font>
<p>Red-ocean companies try to outperform their rivals to grab a greater share of existing demand. (Harvest Demand)</p>

<font color="blue"><b>Blue-Ocean:</b></font>
<p>Blue-ocean companies access untapped market space and create demand. (Create Demand)</p>

<p><strong>PS</strong>: One thing should be noted that even in the same market, depends on what market segment you are focus on, the strategy for red-ocean or blue-ocean could be different. For instance which the book tells us that, BI is a bloody red-ocean, but you could just focus on SMB which is a blue-ocean in 2019.</p>

<p><strong>Why dose this matter to PLG?</strong>  <br />
Depends on what kind of business you are doing, the strategy for blue-ocean could be different. For most of the time, leverage SLG is a good choice for blue-ocean, because blue-ocean mean your idea or concept is quite new to the end-users, the market is not that mature. You need to educate user and deliver your value to specific customer at first. Like sales-force at very beginning. However, we can‚Äôt deny, if your business is quick time-to-value, use PLG is also a great idea. For example your product is as simple as Spotify, everybody need it every day etc. SLG is the beginning but not the end, you need to ask ‚Äúwhen‚Äù not ‚Äúif‚Äù you‚Äôre going to launch a PLG arm of business.  <br />
In a red-ocean, market share, CAC is everything. You need to grow as fast and profitably as possible. PLG help you widen your funnel,  decrease your CAC and help you expand globally in a fraction of time, also could convert ‚Äúnon-customers‚Äù - people who typically won‚Äôt reach out to request pricing or sign up for a demo request. However, these non-customers are willing to try your product if it‚Äôs in PLG model.</p>

<p><strong>Questions to ask yourself when deciding between a blue or red ocean?</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Am I creating or capturing existing demand?</li>
  <li>Does the product have a quick time-to-value?</li>
  <li>Will a marketing, sales, or product-led GTM suit my business the best?</li>
</ol>

<p>No matter which you select, there are a few things to keep in mind. First of all, it is important to remember that value creation and innovation are critical success factors. Also, remain aware of the industry that you are competing against as well as new introductions to the market that may disrupt any market share that you have attained</p>

<h2 id="top-down-or-button-up">Top Down or Button Up</h2>
<p>From audience prospective, to-down or button-up strategy are always be needed.
<a href="https://www.cleverism.com/top-vs-bottom-selling-strategies-best-business"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PLG/bottomup-topdown.png" alt="bottom-up-top-down" /></a>
¬© Shutterstock.com | Micolas  <br />
When using a top-down selling strategy, your sales team targets key decision-markers and executives, and one reason the top-down sales strategy exists is that business want uniformity. Decision makers like to keep their business organized and allocate resources efficiently. For instance, SAP, Oracle, IBM, the business they are making need them to reach out the key decision makers at very beginning, then convince internal teams to use for software is step 2.
Unlike the top-down selling strategy, where it may take months or years to close a sale, bottom-up selling strategies demand quick adoption and simplicity. A big reason to choose a PLG in bottom-up strategy is that if people can‚Äôt see the value in using your product quickly, fiw will upgrade.</p>

<p>Pros and Cons of top-down and bottom-up selling strategies.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A top-down selling strategy pairs well with a sales-led go-to-market strategy</li>
  <li>A bottom-up selling strategy works almost exclusively with a product-led go-to-market strategy</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Top-Down Selling Strategy</strong></p>

<font color="green"><b> Pros:  </b></font>
<ul>
  <li>High ACV</li>
  <li>Additional Services</li>
  <li>Low Customer Churn</li>
</ul>

<font color="red"><b> Cons:  </b></font>
<ul>
  <li>Poor revenue distribution</li>
  <li>High CAC</li>
  <li>Long Sales Cycles</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bottom-Up Selling Strategy</strong></p>

<font color="green"><b> Pros:  </b></font>
<ul>
  <li>Wider top-of-funnel</li>
  <li>Lower CAC</li>
  <li>Predictable sales figures</li>
  <li>Revenue Diversity</li>
  <li>Scale globally fast</li>
  <li>Fast sales cycles</li>
</ul>

<font color="red"><b> Cons:  </b></font>
<ul>
  <li>Contract size</li>
  <li>Non-paying customers</li>
  <li>Significant investments</li>
  <li>Expertise shortage</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What selling strategy is right for you?</strong>  <br />
If your product has a freemium model and a top-down selling strategy, the two approaches will repel each other. However, if you align your product-led model with your selling strategy, you‚Äôll have unmatchable synergy.      <br />
<img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PLG/bottomup-topdown-matrix.png" alt="bottomup-topdown-matrix" /></p>

<p><strong>Two Important Takeaways</strong>  <br />
In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Freemium and top-down selling</code>, the freemium model rarely works with a top-down selling strategy for a few reasons. First, you‚Äôre expecting decision-makers and executives to understand how to use your product. Most decision-makers won‚Äôt be everyday users of the product, so it doesn‚Äôt make sense to onboard them in the first place. This is true and struck a chord with me as I am working in SaaS company for 6 years.  <br />
In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Free trial and top-down selling</code>, you should not be focus on short-term revenue at very beginning, keep the leads warm, well educate the decision-maker and end-user should be the first place otherwise failure comes.</p>

<p><strong>Questions to ask yourself when deciding between a top-down or bottom-up selling strategy</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Are you currently targeting people who can easily use your product and experience its value?</li>
  <li>What is your ACV for each customer? Is it high enough to justify a low- or high-touch sales model?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="showcase-value-as-fast-as-possible">Showcase value as fast as possible</h2>
<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PLG/showcase_fast.png" alt="showcase_fast" /></p>

<p>From the book, author show us the matrix as above, and back to the real world, the main principle for PLG is time-to-value as fast as possible. 40%-60% of users never come back after signing up. So, how do improve it?  <br />
Let‚Äôs analyze your existing users in four types:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Mission Impossible Users  <br />
Low motivation and also found your product really hard to use</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rookie Users <br />
High motivation and really want to try your product even if your product is hard to use</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Veteran Users  <br />
Low motivation, whatever how hard to use, they always could find the points but also they may flee at any time</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spoiled Users  <br />
High motivation and also, found your product is perfect match their needs and easy to use</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now, ask yourself which user are you most familiar with? Also, try to think about the questions as below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How motivated are users when they sign up for your product?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is your product easy for your target audience to use?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can users experience the core value of your product without hand-holding?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Last but not the least, always remember, <font color="green"><b> eliminate unnecessary steps in your onboarding </b></font>.</p>

<h1 id="build-your-foundation">Build Your Foundation</h1>

<h2 id="build-plg-foundation">Build PLG Foundation</h2>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Risk comes from not knowing what you're doing

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PLG/UCD.png" width="300" height="300" title="UDC framework" /></p>

<p>PLG is a life raft that will save you from the flood of rising customer acquisition costs and decreasing willingness to pay for your product. In the book, WES show us a framework that could let us know how to build a solid foundation for your PLG.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>U</strong>nderstand your value</li>
  <li><strong>C</strong>ommunicate the perceived value of your product.</li>
  <li><strong>D</strong>eliver on what you promise</li>
</ul>

<p>UDC framework is that you can apply it to any of these scenarios:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You‚Äôre just launching a business and want to go down the product-led path.</li>
  <li>You‚Äôre starting a product-led arm of an existing company.</li>
  <li>You‚Äôre transitioning from a sales-led to a product-led business.</li>
  <li>You want to relaunch your product-led model because it‚Äôs currently under-performing.</li>
</ol>

<p>Skip any step may raise the risk for delivering a mediocre experience to the user.</p>

Most technology companies get caught up in the features and don‚Äôt really know why people buy their product. So, they create blank headlines that read, ‚ÄúWe sell XXX software for XXX support‚Äù. Boring and without any value. Why people choose your product over another?</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"Cheating on customer development is like cheating on your parachute-packing class." It's not worth it.    
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>The three reasons that people buy a product</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Functional Outcome: the core tasks that customers want to get done
This is the basic outcome that user need from your product. Like using Google Ads to acquire leads and using BI tool to understand the core KPI of the business.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Emotional Outcome: how customers want to feel or avoid feeling as a result of executing the core functional outcome
Emotional outcome could be someone‚Äôs feeling after they using the product. For example, user feel empowered when they using  Google Ads found a big leads etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Social Outcome: how customers want to be perceived by others by using your product
For example you show a weekly leads report to your colleagues in fancy charts and structured data, and this makes you more professional in their eyes</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you can understand the three main outcomes behind why people buy your product and execute on it, you‚Äôre on the right track to building a strong product-led foundation. The challenge, however, is always in the execution. <strong>For instance, if your product offers video hosting but people sign up thinking that you‚Äôre a video marketing agency, they‚Äôre doomed from the start</strong>.  <br />

<p>So, what‚Äôs the value metrics of your product? If you‚Äôre selling shoes, then your value metrics is ‚Äòper pair of shoes‚Äô, if you‚Äôre running a video platform, the value metrics could be the number of videos uploaded and for communication application, the value metrics could be number of messages sent. <strong>Your value metrics play a vital role in how you price your product, set up your product metrics, and build your team</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>What Makes a Good Value Metrics</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>It‚Äôs easy for the customer to understand
    <ol>
      <li>When someone visits your pricing page, will they immediately understand what they‚Äôre paying for and where they fit in your packaging?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>It‚Äôs align with the value that the customer receives in the product
    <ol>
      <li>What core components lead someone to experience a meaningful outcomes?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Grows with your customer‚Äôs usage of the value (Check more on <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/why-do-saas-companies-still-charge-by-the-user/">OpenView website</a>)
    <ol>
      <li>Get more, charge more.</li>
      <li>User based or not? Think before you select per using pricing. The more of these conditions are true, the better per user pricing will work for your business.  <br />

      <li>Usage based value metric has a better shot at reflecting the unique value perceived by customers for your specific product. For example, charge by the number of space, the widgets or content in each space etc. 
<a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/why-do-saas-companies-still-charge-by-the-user/"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PLG/usagebased.png" alt="usagebased" /></a></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>When you are in an early stage of your growth, you have tremendous flexibility to experiment with different value metrics and pricing structures.</p>

<p><strong>How to find your value metric</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Subjective Analysis</strong>

    <p><strong>Data-Driven Approach</strong>  <br />
Classify user into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Churn Quickly</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Barely Use</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Power User</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User with High Lifetime Value</code>, and ask yourself when analyzing your data:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>For best customers</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>What do my best customers do regularly in the product?</li>
          <li>What do my best customers not do in the product?</li>
          <li>What features did my best users try first during onboarding?</li>
          <li>What similarities among my best users that led to success? demographics? team structure or ability?</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><strong>For churned customers</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>What were some of the main differences between their user journey and that of your best customers?</li>
          <li>Specifically, what activities were different? What outcomes did your churned users achieve and not achieve?</li>
          <li>Were these churned customers in your target market?</li>
          <li>Why did the majority of these customers churn?</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Once we know the answers and collect them together, abstract these into the value metrics, then you could know what kinds of users you could serve and what‚Äôs the value metrics is well-fitted for them. This could be different value metrics for different users in different products.</p>

<p>For companies who are used to sales led growth, hid the price and sale the product by relationships is a norm. In contrast, PLG give prospects a clear plan and also incentive them to upgrade by provide them a good value guidance. In the book, Wes show us how to treat your pricing and customer acquisition model right.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Don‚Äôt overcomplicate your pricing page</strong>
Follow the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">five-second test</code>, to see if users could understand which plan is right for them almost immediately, otherwise your plan may be overcomplicated. About the best practice of how to make a price plan, <a href="https://optinmonster.com/pricing-page-best-practices/">here</a> is a perfect article which the author elaborate in 20 aspects, like the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Simplify the Design</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Make the Copy Easy to Understand</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Address the FUDs(Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt.)</code> etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Don‚Äôt create a free plan with no incentive to upgrade</strong>  <br />
You are not running a charity, <strong>where to draw the line, this could be a tough balance</strong>. Offering a key feature for free makes your customer acquisition model more powerful, but you‚Äôll drain resources , too. Make your decision based on your key value metrics data monitoring.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Don‚Äôt make it a no-brainer for the majority of your customers to downgrade</strong>
There‚Äôs no way to avoid this entirely, but you can minimize risk. Look at the number of customers who use only the tools and features you‚Äôre about to give away for free:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>How many of these paying customers would be a prime fit for your free plan?</li>
      <li>What percentage of these paying customers are you willing to risk losing?</li>
      <li>How many more users do you expect top generate by giving away this free feature?</li>
      <li>Is it worth it for your business to give this feature away for free?</li>
      <li>Does this free feature include a value metric?
Still, ask yourself a key question before you make the decision about which part should give away for free, <strong>Are you willing to take a short-term dip in revenue for a long-term gain?</strong></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Four Common Pricing Strategies</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Best-Judgement Pricing
You and your team decide your price based on what you think is reasonable. Best judgement pricing is the <font color="green"><b>least effective pricing strategy</b></font> because you rely on the collective experience of your team, and you make assumptions about what your buyer values and is willing to pay. But, on the other side, it‚Äôs easy to <font color="red"><b>sell unprofitable products without knowing it</b></font>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cost-Plus Pricing
This is simple, calculate the cost of selling and delivering the product, then add a profit margin on top. But there is one point that everyone can‚Äôt just simply ignore it that the margin cost for SaaS is low while you start to supporting a new customer. So, this means you probably <font color="red"><b>say goodbye to your profit potential if you use this strategy</b></font>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Competitor-Based Pricing
Find your competitor‚Äôs price and decide yours. This is simple too. Sometimes it‚Äôs works especially when you <font color="green"><b>have no idea how to decide your price at very beginning</b></font> when you get into a new market. But is strategy also has limitation.
    <ol>
      <li>First, you‚Äôre assuming that you sell to the <font color="red"><b>exact same customer</b></font> who has the <font color="red"><b>exact same problem</b></font> that you can solve with your <font color="red"><b>exact same product</b></font>.</li>
      <li>Second, you‚Äôre assuming that your competitor do the pricing research, but unfortunately, <font color="red"><b>seven out of ten companies do not do their pricing research</b></font>, you are banking your livelihood on someone else‚Äôs guessing game.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Value-Based Pricing
Value-based pricing bases your price on the value you provide. You determine this by taking into account how prospects value your product. A significant benefit of value-based pricing is that <font color="green"><b>you'll learn what to include in each package</b></font>.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, which pricing approach will you take? Let‚Äôs listen what does Patrick Campbell said.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Each of these pricing strategies has its place in business. If you're running a gas station, 
you're probably cost-plus pricing. If you are in the ultra-competitive retail space, 
pricing in line with competitors will be close to the price the market can sustain. 
But in SaaS, the only viable option is value-based. You are not only give customers 
what they want, but you'll also be able to attract and retain these customers better.    
                                                                - CEO if ProfitWell
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>How to Determine Your Price</strong>
Most businesses whip up a new pricing model in a spreadsheet without talking to a single customer. To avoid bombing with your new pricing model, break down your customer‚Äôs perceived value across the three core outcomes your product solves for functional, emotional, and social.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Option1: Pricing Economic Value Analysis</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Functional Outcome</strong>: 
The core tasks that customers want to get done. Usually can break down into factors such as incremental revenue, reduced cost, reduced risk or time saving. For example, your product could help your customer save 1 formal employees whose salary(Include Provident fund) is ÔºÑ8000/month, and also could reduce the time of generating the final report from 1 week to 1 day. Then your product price should not be less than ÔºÑ9600/year at least (<strong>10X rules: Provide customer 10X value</strong>).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Emotional Outcome</strong>: How customers want to feel, or avoid feeling - as a result of executing the core functional job, for example, you can tell your customer that you no longer need to hire a full time employee to crunch the number for almost a week to get the final report every quarter, what you just needed is get the report automatically in the product and use another day to refine the report, then everything done. What do you think how much would this customer pay for your product? I think maybe he could agree for ÔºÑ9600/year or ÔºÑ11000/year.  <strong>Emotions play a key role in our decision-making process both online and offline and in order to truly grow your business you have to start understanding your customers and their decision-making process better</strong>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Social Outcome</strong>: How customers want to be perceived by others, maybe your product could make your customers feel like a ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù during a presentation or make him or her promoted after using your product. Your customers like share the report with your logo, recommend it his colleagues or teammates. All of these are social outcome that your product could provide to your user.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Basing your pricing on market and customer research is one of the best ways to understand how much your customer is willing to pay for your product or services. In the book, the author call it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter</code>. Finding an acceptable price range is especially important to avoid we set our price too high to lose the majority of sales or too low to lose out the majority of profits.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Option2: Market and Customer Research</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare Question to Ask
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Too Expensive</strong>: At what price point would you consider our product tobe so expensive that you would not consider buying it?</li>
          <li><strong>Expensive</strong>: At what price point would you consider our product so expensive that you would give it some thought before buying?</li>
          <li><strong>Bargain</strong>: At what price point would you consider our product to be a great deal for the money?</li>
          <li><strong>Too Cheap</strong>: At what price point would you consider our product so inexpensive that you would feel the quality couldn‚Äôt be excellent?</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>How to Ask
        <ol>
          <li>Survey tools</li>
          <li>Interviews  <br />
<img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PLG/survey_tool.png" alt="survey_tool" /></li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Crunch the Numbers
Once you know your <strong>PMC(Point of Marginal Cheapness)</strong> and <strong>PME(Point of Marginal Expensiveness)</strong>, you‚Äôve found your acceptable price range: the space between bothy points.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PLG/pricing_model.jpg" alt="pricing_model" /></p>

    <p>As the product evolves, you would better do the price research at a specific interval.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What Should You Put on Your Pricing Page?</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Value Metric</li>
  <li>Willingness to pay for all packages</li>
  <li>Valued features
    <ol>
      <li>Leaders</li>
      <li>Fillers</li>
      <li>Bundle killers</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Demographic Information
    <ol>
      <li>It allows your audience to self-segment quicker</li>
      <li>It helps you prioritize the features and benefits that are most valuable to the target audience</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
